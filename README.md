This project was implemented during the summer training period for the year 2020 at (Smart Methods) Company and the property rights are reserved for them.
The task is: Creating a web page contains a controller for the robot to allow the robot to move right, left, forward, and backward. You can as well stop the robot from moving. This controller web page does nothing when you click on any arrow because it still does not have the functionalities and it is not connected to the real robot yet.
